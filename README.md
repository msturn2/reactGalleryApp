# *React Gallery App*

## Project Overview

For this project, I used the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

Using the Create React App tool, I set up the initial project.

Then I:

- Wrote JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages, search page, no results page and 404 page.
- Used [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to fetch data from the Flickr API and then display images in the app.
- Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Added custom styling to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
  - Styling includes:
    - Gradient for body and photo-container class
    - Border and box-shadow for image li tag
    - Focus added to Search Bar with transitional coloring
    - Vader gif added to 404 route with transitional hover and link to Home route
    - Changed text color to 404 route h1 tag

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
